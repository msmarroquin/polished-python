# polished-python

I enjoy collecting nail polish, as well as being "in the know" about the nail polish world, so I scraped a of couple nail polish brands' websites to figure out what colors are currently (as of January 2022) the most popular within the "best sellers" category.

In this Python3 project, I use a web-scraping package called [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a regular expression library called [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) to create a bar chart, [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/numpy-user.pdf) to structure my data in a way that agrees with pandas, and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index) to make a nail polish donut.

Multicolored polish reigns over the best sellers at Cirque Colors.
